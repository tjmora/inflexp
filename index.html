                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="bold">Inflection Expressions</span>, or <span class="bold">inflexp</span> for short, are a
                    sequence of characters that define the rules or steps that should be undertaken by an implementing software 
                    library in inflecting a base or root word. Inflexp has character sequences for prefixation, infixation, 
                    suffixation, repetition (of the word or its syllables), sound change (including stress and tone change), 
                    sound dropping, supplantation, and others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This specification is agnostic on how libraries should implement their data structures and method logic. 
                    To give an example however, one way to implement inflexp is to define a <span class="code">class Word</span>
                    which main <span class="code">value</span> is of an array type <span class="code">Syllable[]</span> and where
                    each <span class="code">Syllable</span> has some or all of the following properties:
                    <span class="code">preMark: char</span>
                    <span class="code">initial: char</span>, 
                    <span class="code">medial: char</span>,
                    <span class="code">nucleus: char</span>,
                    <span class="code">coda: char[]</span>,
                    <span class="code">stress: bool</span>,
                    <span class="code">tone: char</span>,
                    <span class="code">postMark: char</span>.
                    Then various inflection methods can be defined to manipulate the syllables and their properties.

                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="bold">Inflexp</span> originally arose from another open-source natural language project, 
                    <a href="https://github.com/tjmora" class="bold">Halita</a>. Halita is a word-inflection and -deinflection 
                    library for Philippine languages like Tagalog. The many native languages of the Philippines are inflected 
                    languages. As different Philippine languages have different affixes and different ways of repeating their 
                    syllables and root words, a new kind of inflection expression was needed. A simple prefix expression like 
                    <span class="code">pag-</span> can only do so much when many other Philippine languages don't only prepend 
                    a prefix, but also introduce sound changes and root word transformations along the way.
