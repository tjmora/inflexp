                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="bold">Inflection Expressions</span>, or <span class="bold">inflexp</span> for short, are a
                    sequence of characters that define the rules or steps that should be undertaken by an implementing software 
                    library in inflecting a base or root word. Inflexp has character sequences for prefixation, infixation, 
                    suffixation, repetition (of the word or its syllables), sound change (including stress and tone change), 
                    sound dropping, supplantation, and others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This specification is agnostic on how libraries should implement their data structures and method logic. 
                    To give an example however, one way to implement inflexp is to define a <span class="code">class Word</span>
                    which main <span class="code">value</span> is of an array type <span class="code">Syllable[]</span> and where
                    each <span class="code">Syllable</span> has some or all of the following properties:
                    <span class="code">preMark: char</span>
                    <span class="code">initial: char</span>, 
                    <span class="code">medial: char</span>,
                    <span class="code">nucleus: char</span>,
                    <span class="code">coda: char[]</span>,
                    <span class="code">stress: bool</span>,
                    <span class="code">tone: char</span>,
                    <span class="code">postMark: char</span>.
                    Then various inflection methods can be defined to manipulate the syllables and their properties.
                </p>

                <h2>I. Background</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="bold">Inflexp</span> originally arose from another open-source natural language project, 
                    <a href="https://github.com/tjmora" class="bold">Halita</a>. Halita is a word-inflection and -deinflection 
                    library for Philippine languages like Tagalog. The many native languages of the Philippines are inflected 
                    languages. As different Philippine languages have different affixes and different ways of repeating their 
                    syllables and root words, a new kind of inflection expression was needed. A simple prefix expression like 
                    <span class="code">pag-</span> can only do so much when many other Philippine languages don't only prepend 
                    a prefix, but also introduce sound changes and root word transformations along the way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Early in the development of Halita, it became apparent that its <span class="code">class Word</span> and 
                    <span class="code">class Syllable</span> source files can be generalized to work not just with Philippine
                    languages but also with other languages in the world. So those source files were taken out of Halita,
                    moved into a new open source project, <a href="https://github.com/tjmora/inflexer" class="bold">
                    Inflexer</a>, and rewritten to reflect their new purpose. This very document serves to standardize the 
                    specification of the inflection expression used by Inflexer.
                </p>
                <h2>II. Terminology</h2>
                <p>
                    A <span class="bold">character</span> is a symbol or glyph, which can be a letter, a number, an ideogram,
                    a pictogram, a punctuation mark or any other special mark.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A <span class="bold">word</span> is a character or a sequence of characters which on its own provides a 
                    semantic meaning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A <span class="bold">syllable</span> is a phonological (sound-based) building block of a word. It is 
                    comprised at least by a nucleus (which is typically a vowel) with optional onset and final sounds 
                    (which are typically consonants). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    An <span class="bold">initial</span> is any sound, typically a consonant, at the start of a syllable (before
                    the nucleus).
                </p>
                <p>
                    A <span class="bold">medial</span> is any sound, typically a liquid consonant like &lt;l&gt; or &lt;r&gt;
                    or a semivowel like &lt;w&gt; or &lt;j&gt;, that comes after the initial of a syllable but before the 
                    nucleus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A <span class="bold">nucleus</span> is the central part of a syllable, typically a vowel but can also be
                    a syllabic consonant (a consonant that forms a syllable on its own).
                </p>
                <p>
                    A <span class="bold">coda</span> is any sound or sounds, typically consonants, in a syllable that comes 
                    after the nucleus. In some languages, there can be multiple consonants consisting the coda.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A <span class="bold">stress</span> is a an emphasis that may be given to a syllable. Different languages 
                    have different methods for stress. It can be increasing the loudness of the syllable, or lengthening the 
                    pronunciation of the nucleus, or changing the tone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A <span class="bold">tone</span> is a pitch applied to a syllable. In tonal languages like the Chinese 
                    languages, changing the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of the word.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="bold">Special marks</span> are any symbol (like the dash &lt;-&gt; and the apostrophe 
                    &lt;’&gt;) that a syllable contains. These may not be necessarily important when inflecting the words 
                    but may be very important on how the raw syllables are decoded for accurate printing.
                </p>
                <h2>III. Inflection Expressions</h2>
                <p>
                    The table below uses base words that are entirely artificial. As such, the words has no special cases 
                    nor irregularities when inflected through inflexp argument-taking methods. Any natural language-agnostic
                    or orthography-agnostic library should arrive to the same results as shown in the table when inflecting the 
                    same base word with the same inflexp argument in the corresponding row of each result.

                <p class="note">
                    <span>Note: </span> Example words below, like klurtbragstronds, is shown as syllabified to better show how 
                    such a word is represented internally in the data structure used by an implementing library.
                </p>
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <td>Base Word</td><td>Applied inflexp</td><td>Result</td>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr><td>klurt·brags·tronds</td><td>##</td><td>klurt·brags·tronds</td></tr>
